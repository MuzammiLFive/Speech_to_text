Creating a package in python:

1) Create a folder with any name ex:pkg and create a folder with packagename ex:packageMuz.
2) Inside the folder packageMuz create another folder packageMuz.
   alongside this folder there contains:
   a) setup.py
   b) readme.txt
   c) License.txt
3) Create a __init__.py file inside 2nd packageMuz folder. init is a constructor which tells
   setup.py that it contains the package. We can write any code inside __init__.py, run and save
   it.
4) complete setup.py file with all the details of package.
5) Now we create a wheel file(have wheel package installed). Navigate using cd to target location
   >> python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   This will create a directory
6) >> cd dist (a wheel file will be present)
   >> pip install .\packageMuz-0.1-py3-none-any.whl
   This will install the package.
7) >> import packageMuz
