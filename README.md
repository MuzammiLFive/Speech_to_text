# Speech_to_text
Submission for Aganitha Cognitive Solutions data science intern position.

Description:

- Implemented in Python programming.
- Tkinter, a standard python interface, is used to create a simple GUI.
- SpeechRecognition, a python library is used to convert audio files to written english.

Scope for improvements:

- Only WAV files are accepted at the moment, more types of audio formats can also be accomodated.
- Better library to perform speech recognition, here the limitation for me was the limit of github(25 MB) which discouraged me to use other libraries.
- Option to record audio can be added too.
